# AngularJS demo app

This project is an application created for a school project about AngularJS. The app contains the following elements:

To add a new student:
- create a new folder with the last name (or the first in case of multiple surnames)
- create a folder for the presentation card and one for the CV and add the needed HTML, JS and CSS files
- add a new Student object into the $scope.students from the app.js controller with the name, surname, HTML presentation card location, and HTML CV location
