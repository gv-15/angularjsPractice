        Dear Mr. Javier, <br>
        This letter is to express my interest in your posting for an experienced Software Developer.
        With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Master’s degree in Information Technology, and hands-on experience
        using .Net languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.        
    </p><br>
     <p>
        I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing
        to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I’ve attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be reached anytime
        via my cell phone, 555-555-5555 or via email at name@gmail.com.
