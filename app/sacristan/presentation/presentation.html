        With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Master’s degree in Information Technology, and hands-on experience
        using .Net languages to create and implement software applications, especificaly using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL.
        Also i can use differents program languages like Java or C#.
        I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.        
    </p><br>
     <p class="text">
        I enjoy being engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set,
        as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and and I think it can be beneficial for you and your organization
    </p><br>
    <p class="text">
        I’ve attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be reached anytime
