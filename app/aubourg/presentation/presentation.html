            Dear sir,
            <br>
            <br>
            Student of the third year of the engineering curriculum at ISEP, a digital ingineering school in Paris,
            I am searching for a Software Engineer job and I take note of your job proposal via your website.
            New technologies and programming, main subject of my courses at ISEP, captivate me.
            This is why this proposal interests me a lot.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text">
            During my three years of engineering curriculum, I educate myself about web technologies and programming
            languages such as PHP, JavaScript, HTML, SQL and CSS and I could deal with them in depth through the creation of
            a website for a home automation service. Moreover, with the two internship I have realized, I could strongly
            develop this programming skill building a web application developed with Django Framework for NOKIA allowing the
            simulation of the 5G system and developing new security tests and services with PHP for the WITHINGS API.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text">
            I will have my heart set on putting my skills in the service of this project and enhancing me with the knowledge
            I will learn during it.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text">
            Staying available for a meeting. Please accept, Sir, my very best regards.
        </p><br>
        <p><br>
            Sincerely,<br> Cyril Aubourg
